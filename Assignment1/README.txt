Folder contains the following files:
	trig_list.py
		- Computes the trigonometric functions using python lists. 
		- Takes command line arguments of function parameters. Outputs the results in the files "X_list_out.txt", "Y_list_out.txt" and "Z_list_out.txt".
		- To run, type "py trig_list.py <f_x f_y a_x a_y phi dt n>" in the command line. 

	trig_np.py
		- Computes the trigonometric functions using numpy arrays. 
		- Takes command line arguments of function parameters. Outputs the results in the files "X_np_out.txt", "Y_np_out.txt" and "Z_np_out.txt".
		- To run, type "py trig_np.py <f_x f_y a_x a_y phi dt n>" in the command line. 

	plot.py
		- Plots the graph of X(t) against Y(t) from calling trig_lists.py

	rational.py
		- Shows that for rational f_x/f_y, the curves are closed.

	investigate_ratio.py
		- Investigates the relationship between f_x/f_y and the shape of the curve.

	investigate_phase.py
		- Investigates the relationship between \phi and the shape of the curve, setting f_x = f_y.

	beats.py
		- Generates graphs of beats.
